# Python_List_Exercises
#### *Tiny steps make big strides*

In this repository you can find various exercise programs on python lists.

I have picked up these exercise programs from different sources in internet and my daily work experience in my job, Some of the exercise programs may look simple, but i made this repository for easy reference and revision - after all we dont need to memorise programming, its all about understanding and applying.

If you find this repository useful, feel free to use the code snippets and consider following me, i will be creating more repositories regarding python, embedded systems and web development.
